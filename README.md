The Significant Algorithm Solving course exercises at ELTE IK university in hungary.

Solving exercises from old competations.

Mostly working with graphs. 
It is not only about how to solve them, but to make then run fast enought. Some test file contains a huge graph.

The exercises are in hungarian. While my comments and coding are in english.

I used C++, Visual Studio 2015, (.Net windows API). Tested on WIN7 and WIN8.1.
