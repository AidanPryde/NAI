The Significant Algorithm Solving course exercises at ELTE IK university in hungary.

Solving exercises from old competations.

Mostly working with graphs. 
It is not only about how to solve them, but to make then run fast enought. Some test file contains a huge graph.

The exercises are in hungarian. While the program and my comments are in english.
