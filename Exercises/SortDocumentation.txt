It does compile on WIN7 and WIN8.1 with the latest .NET in Visual Studio 2015.

The program usage:

	You have to give the program the exercise number as the first argument of the program.
	You can specified one test file number as the second argument of the program.
	
	The test files names are specific like INPUT01.TXT, INPUT02.TXT, ... .
	You have to gave the numbers as X, not like 0X (as 1, not like 01).
	The program will process the test file(s) from root/In-Outputs/<exercise number>/In/.
	Then put the output file(s) to the root/In-Outputs/<exercise number>/Out/ mappa.
	Rewrite the file(s) there with the same name.
	The output file(s) name(s) are like OUTPUT01.TXT and so on.
	
	The root is burned in the main file right now for debuging (the exe root is commented.)
	
	The details of the exercises can be found at http://fi.inf.elte.hu/adatszerkezet/implementalas/feladatok.html and in the Descriptions mappa.
	
	The numbers of the worked out exercises are 9, 25, 46, 52, 70, 77, 78.

Structure:

	main	<-- RunTimeTimer (Help to get run time.)
			<-- Logic (The code that answers the problems.)
				<-- IOHandler (Read in the test files, and write the output.)

	You can find the magic in the logic. The exercises are broken down to 3 parts.
		The control generateResultXX function, that run the generateResultXX_Setup and the generateResultXX_Calculate.
		The read in generateResultXX_Setup and refine it if we have to.
		The calculater generateResultXX_Calculate, that uses the read in data. Write out the sollutions.
		
	It throws exceptions, if it got a wrong agrument, but it do not check the test inputs.
